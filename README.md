# js-etch-a-sketch

In this project, I attempted to create a web toy based on the Etch-a-sketch. The toy lets you generate a square grid of up to 100x100 pixels which the user can "draw" on with their mouse. On mouseover, each pixel gets filled in.

This was my first attempt at making a toy with vanilla JavaScript. I think it has improved my understanding of DOM interactions with vanilla JS and helped me get a handle on using event listeners.
